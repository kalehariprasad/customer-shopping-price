# Sculpture Shopping Price Prediction App

This Streamlit app allows users to predict sculpture prices based on various features. Whether you want to analyze a single sculpture or make bulk predictions, this app has got you covered!

## Key Features:

- **Train a Model:** Explore the machine learning model training process for predicting sculpture prices. This is a demonstration page and does not require uploading a training dataset.

- **Batch Prediction:** Predict prices for multiple sculptures at once by uploading a CSV file.

- **Single Prediction:** Predict the price of a single sculpture by providing its details.

## How to Use:

1. **Train a Model:**
   - Click on 'Train Model' in the sidebar.
   - Upload your training dataset and start training.

2. **Batch Prediction:**
   - Select 'Batch Prediction' in the sidebar.
   - Upload a CSV file with sculpture details.
   - View the predictions in a table.

3. **Single Prediction:**
   - Select 'Single Prediction' in the sidebar.
   - Enter the sculpture details.
   - Click 'Predict' to get the estimated price.

## Sample Dataset:

To get started, you can use the sample dataset provided in the [`data`](data) directory. The sample dataset contains example input data in CSV format. You can download the sample dataset from the following link:
[Download Sample Batch Prediction Dataset](https://github.com/kalehariprasad/sculpture-shopping-price/tree/main/data)

The sample dataset provides a template for the input file format expected by the app. You can open the CSV file to see the example input data and use it as a reference when preparing your own dataset for batch prediction.
